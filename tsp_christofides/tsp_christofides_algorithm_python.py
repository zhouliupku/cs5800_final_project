Minimum Spanning Tree is generated using Prim's Algorithm with binary heap
implementation. Using python embeded library heapq.

Minimum Weight Perfect Matching is generated using .max_weight_matching function
in NetworkX python library.

To use this program, please install networkx and matplotlib library use
pip install networkx
pip install matplotlib
